1,1,PixelatedThinker,"Thank God the doctors are fighting back. People like RFK Jr. have zero business running our health agencies, they're putting millions at risk with pure fake news.",8,1 day ago 
2,1,QuantumLeapfrog,"I'm glad this lawsuit is happening, but blue states better be ready to hold the line. The fight over state vs. federal power is just getting started.",4,1 day ago 
3,1,BasicallyBrie,Screw these anti-vaccine politicians! This is what happens when you let incompetent politicians with their own agendas run the government's response.,1,1 day ago 
4,2,PixelatedThinker,This lawsuit is just a political hit job. The pro-vaccine establishment is trying to crush the first administration that actually has the guts to challenge their narrative.,8,1 day ago 
5,2,QuantumLeapfrog,"Screw these Doctors ! They have a clear political interest in protecting the last administration's agenda. This isn't about being impartial, it's just their political campaign continuing.",4,1 day ago 
6,2,BasicallyBrie,"These doctors are on the wrong side of the debate. For so many of us, those policies were a political power grab from day one. This lawsuit is just them trying to get back the control they lost.",1,1 day ago 
7,3,PixelatedThinker,"The scientific findings provide important context to support the doctors. The data from multiple studies keeps confirming that the vaccines are safe for the heart, which is crucial.",8,1 day ago 
8,3,QuantumLeapfrog,The doctors suing have powerful science backing them up. Large-scale studies show a significant reduction in all-cause mortality for the vaccinated—a massive finding that points to a clear protective benefit.,4,1 day ago 
9,3,BasicallyBrie,The doctors are right to stand up for science. The data is clear: peer-reviewed studies show a mild COVID infection causes much more cellular stress and vascular inflammation than the vaccine itself.,1,1 day ago 
10,4,PixelatedThinker,"The science was flawed from day one. The original clinical trials literally used problematic samples, which makes the results totally unscientific for the general population.",8,1 day ago 
11,4,QuantumLeapfrog,"There are serious scientific findings being totally ignored. I mean, isn’t there literally published research from Italy showing a direct impact on the pineal gland?",4,1 day ago 
12,4,BasicallyBrie,"The approval process for these shots was a joke, so why is no one talking about the controversy? You have a lead scientist from J&J himself admitting there was a ""lack of research"" and the product was rush",1,1 day ago 
13,5,PixelatedThinker,"This is definitive proof of why this vaccine is so essential. The fact that it works against new strains, on top of all the data we already have on its heart safety, really gives us the full scientific picture of how well it performs.",8,1 day ago 
14,5,QuantumLeapfrog,"This is exactly the fantastic news we were hoping for. The data shows the tech is adaptable and the updated vaccine works on the new variants, exactly the positive outcome you'd hope for based on the early research.",4,1 day ago 
15,5,BasicallyBrie,It's great to see the updated vaccines are effective. This adds to the strong data we already have and counters the claims of vaccines being unsafe.,1,1 day ago 
16,6,PixelatedThinker,"""Effective"" based on what? Another round of flawed trials that kicked out anyone with health problems? You can't claim it works if the science was messed up from the start.",8,1 day ago 
17,6,QuantumLeapfrog,"Sure, it's ""effective against new strains,"" but did they fix the neurological side effects? I mean, isn’t there literally published research from Italy showing a direct impact on the pineal gland?",4,1 day ago 
18,6,BasicallyBrie,"Why should we trust this? A lead scientist from J&J is already on record saying the last shots were rushed with a ""lack of research."" It's hard to believe the process is any better this time around.",1,1 day ago 
19,7,PixelatedThinker,"This is great news, but you just know the administration with people like RFK Jr. will try to block it or spread fake news. Their only goal is scoring political points, they don't care about the facts.",8,1 day ago 
20,7,QuantumLeapfrog,"This is good news for the blue states! Now their leaders can say ""See? We were right!"" They can tell the big government, ""You can't tell us what to do!""",4,1 day ago 
21,7,BasicallyBrie,"Our government should support this progress. Ultimately, history will judge the politicians who helped advance it versus those who obstructed it for political gain.",1,1 day ago 
22,8,PixelatedThinker,"Who cares what this new study claims? The CDC and FDA have zero credibility, and they have been playing politics with their own agenda for years. This is just more propaganda from a captured agency.",8,1 day ago 
23,8,QuantumLeapfrog,"Boo to another ""safe and effective"" booster. This just proves the swamp is still in charge. Even with the new guys in office, the unelected bureaucrats are still pushing the same old agenda. ",4,1 day ago 
24,8,BasicallyBrie,"Another lie about vaccines being ""effective against new strains.""  This is just the latest excuse for the other party to push their political agenda. It was always about forcing their political policies on everyone, and this is just another tool to do it.",1,1 day ago
